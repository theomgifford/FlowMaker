Notes:
 -- qubits take a reference junction and sort of draw the qubit to the side of the junction (see ComponentDocs)
 -- qubits are Components too, and have defaults in the same way the other Components do

~~~ EXAMPLE OUTLINE FOR ADDING QUBITS ~~~

### import necessary qubits

from qubits.sawtooth_qubit import SawtoothQubit

### initalize normally
chip = Chip(size)

### draw a straight and store it
qubit_straight = CPWStraight(chip,straight_settings)

### draw a qubit on one of the junctions of the straight
Q = SawtoothQubit(chip,settings={'refjunc':qubit_straight.cxns['in']})

~~~ ALTERNATIVELY ~~~

### initialize a list of straights that need qubits
qubit_straights = []

### add straights to this list
qubit_straights.append(CPWStraight(chip,straight_settings))

### iterate over all these straights and add qubits
Qs = []
for straight in qubit_straights:
    Qs.append(SawtoothQubit(chip,settings={'refjunc':straight.cxns['in']}))

~~~ OR AS A FINAL ALTERNATIVE ~~~

### initialize a list of refjuncs that need qubits
qubit_junctions = []

### add junctions to this list
qubit_junctions.append(straight.cxns['in'])

### iterate over all these junctions and add qubits
Qs = []
for junc in qubit_junctions:
    Qs.append(SawtoothQubit(chip,settings={'refjunc':junc}))
