    "\n",
    "[MaskMaker](https://github.com/KollarLab/MaskMaker) contains code for drawing our coplanar-waveguide devices, and exports that drawing as a **dxf** file. Most basic components one would want to use for a device (a straight section of coplanar waveguide, a bent section of coplanar waveguide, various couplers) have been written as classes. The user can store and access information about individual components in instances of these classes, allowing for smoother and more flexible design. In addition, MaskMaker standardizes the way components are written in code, to enable more efficient collaboration in future development. All measurements are in **microns**."

    "### **4.3** Qubit Pockets and Paddles\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of qubits is still in development. At the moment, MaskMaker has the capability to draw trapezoidal qubit pockets and one type of digitated qubit paddles. It cannot draw any of the E-beam layers. For an outline of a script that implements qubits, see <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\docs\\\">**add_qubit_outline**</abbr>.\n",
    "\n",
    "MaskMaker contains three potentially useful qubit classes: <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\qubits\\notch\">`QubitNotchFromJunc`</abbr> draws a simple trapezoidal pocket. <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\qubits\\digitated_qubit\">`DigitatedQubit`</abbr> draws a digitated qubit design with a cutout on one end for the qubit write, and then calls `QubitNotchFromJunc` to create a pocket around it. However, the most important qubit class is <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\qubits\\custom_qubit\">`CustomQubit`</abbr>. This allows the user to import a qubit from a dxf file and package it inside of a `QubitNotchFromJunc`. For an example of its usage, see <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\example_scripts\\\">**test_script_custom_qubits**</abbr>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, qubits are added to CPW elements by specifying a reference junction at a connection point of the CPW element. As seen in <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\docs\\\">**ComponentDocs**</abbr>, the qubit notch is drawn behind the reference junction, so that passing a connection junction of a `CPWStraight` draws the notch on that straight.\n",

    "### **4.4** Importing DXF Files\n",

    "MaskMaker also has the capability to import any DXF file onto a <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\mask\">`Chip`</abbr>, using the class <attr title=\"MaskMaker\\import_dxf\">`ImportedDXF`</attr>. The imported DXF can be scaled/reflected, translated, or rotated. The call is quite straightforward, and functions like any other <abbr title=\"MaskMaker\\component\">`Component`</abbr>."
